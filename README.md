# NinjaAssist
This is an emergency code generator for FIRST Robotics Competition teams who are stuck without any code and just need to move. Simply clone this repository, run [setup.py](https://github.com/FRC5892/NinjaAssist/setup.py), and you will be provided with a functioning robot program powered by [GradleRIO](https://github.com/Open-RIO/GradleRIO).

The output is the most basic possible robot program, providing only the capability for basic driving in TeleOp and forwards movement in Autonomous. It is designed for simplicity rather than extensibility. If/when your robot requires more features, we encourage you to write your own code from the ground up rather than try to build on top of this. For an example of a more robust robot program, feel free to check out [our actual code for this year](https://github.com/FRC5892/2018PowerUp).
